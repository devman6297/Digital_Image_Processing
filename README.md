# Digital Image Processing - Lab 1

Introduction to Color Images

Color images are composed of three primary color channels: Red (R), Green (G), and Blue (B). Each channel represents intensity values for its respective color, combining to form a full-color image. Understanding how to process these channels individually is fundamental in digital image processing.

This lab introduces you to:

Reading color images.

Extracting individual color components (R, G, B).

Converting color images to grayscale.
